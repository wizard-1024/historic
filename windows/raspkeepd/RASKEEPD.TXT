RAS Connection Keep Daemon (WIN32 Service)
Copyright (c) 1997 Dmitry V. Stefankov

The program was designed for the RAS connection keep
on the leased line because other known programs don't work
for a such lines (for example, STARTRAS, KEEPCON, ARASNT, REDIAL).
But this program supported the dial-up line also well. 

The program consists of two files:
RASKEEP.CPL   - RAS Connection Keep Daemon Control Applet
RASKEEPD.EXE  - RAS Connection Keep Daemon WIN32 Service

What you must do?
(1) You must copy both files to directoty %RootDir%\SYSTEM32.
(2) Install the service by the command "raskeepd -install"
    (of course, without quotas)
(3) Adjust parameters for your connection
(4) Run this service through ControlPanel\Services or
    by the command "start net raskeepservice"

The current version is only for evaluation purposes.
Use it for your own risk.
