                                (Really, to fix a problem caused bad code
                                 of System Commander - OS boot manager;
                                SC code was designed only for 486 machines
                                but now only Pentium+ machines are on market
                                and wrong timing algorithm hangs up ATAPI
                                CD-ROM drives during DOS boostrap.)
