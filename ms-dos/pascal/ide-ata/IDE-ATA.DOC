------------------- Part 1 (Identification) ------------------------------

Program Name:                   IDE-ATA.PAS
Version:                        2
Release:                        63
Date:                           24 November 1998
History:                        Original idea was found in the program
                                written by Thomas J. Newman (1991) which is
                                called IDE-INFO. I wrote my program because
                                I found in July of 1992 the sowjet program
                                IDE-BUS in which a stolen code from Newman's 
                                IDE-INFO is present. I was angry. I like 
                                neither a lie and a stealing. I wrote my own
                                version with indication of original source of
                                idea of my program. My Great Thanks to Thomas!
                                I hope this version is reported about
                                IDE-ATA drive all useful info what we need.
