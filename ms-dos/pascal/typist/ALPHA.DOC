LIST OF FOUND PROBLEMS:   
- PCTOOLS don't remove first character from text pattern to replace
- middle search (NO CASE-TRANSLATION!) for russian language
- Analyzing of input string from beginning is taken too much garbage 
  (maybe take string from end?)
- BRIEF filters BS key (CTRL-H); maybe add switch <put PC scancode>;
  because it uses own keyboard mapping scheme
- ALT key causes some conflicts with pull-down menu based on same key
- PWB filters all control characters, works very slowly, why??
- NE 1.3 has same problem as PWB (filter control characters)
- IBM E has same problem as PWB (filter control characters)
