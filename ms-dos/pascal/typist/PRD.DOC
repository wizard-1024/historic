I wish to thank all of you for all the useful information, so I'm going 
to share one of my useful trade not-so-secrets.

Anyone who does a lot of typing should get PRD+.  It is a TSR program 
that is easy to use and program.  You put in "shorthand" letters that 
expand into the full phrase, word, whatever when you hit an ending 
delimiter (period, comma, etc.).  For example, tell the program that c/b 
is to be expanded to "could be" and it will do it every time.

I type 120 wpm and it increases my speed as much as 25%.  I use it for
names, repetitive phrases, to correct common typos, commonly-used
addresses -- very fast and easy.
