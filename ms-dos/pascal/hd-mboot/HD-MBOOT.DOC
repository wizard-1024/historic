Program Name:                   HD-MBOOT.PAS
Version:                        1
Release:                        33
Date:                           2 September 1997
History:                        Written for internal use of author
                                and his friends and all who don't want lose
                                hard disk parameters every time when CMOS
                                will disappeared.
                                ( Bad note: 
                                I wrote this program when I had recovered data 
                                from hard disk of girl IRINA JAROWAYA.
                                She came and taken back recovered disk,
                                and ... she was killed by a mafia at the same 
                                evening. Very criminal land! )
                                In my small satellite communications company
                                we have 2.5 GB 5.25" Quantum IDE disk drive 
                                installed on old 386 machine, and, of course, 
                                w/o BIOS support. Therefore I modified HD-MBOOT
                                and OS-BOOT code to work together because this
                                machine run two OS: DOS/Windows pair and 
                                FreeBSD UNIX. All works great! 
                                ( Last note:
                                 Just write own code good and 
                                 you will use this code always! )
